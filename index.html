                    <h4>What is paper quilling?</h4>
                    <p>The art of paper quilling is a centurys-old craft that involves curling thin strips of paper into coils, which are then pinched into shapes 
                    and arranged into patterns.</p>

                    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
                    <p id="artist"> Hi! My name is Mari Schwartz. I first saw paperquilling when I was about 10 years old, when my uncle graduated school for graphic design. 
                        One of the other students displaying a presentation that day was showing her art, which happened to be paperquilling. 
                        I was immediately facinated. As soon as I got home, I cut a sticky note into strips and tried rolling it up into a flower. 
                        Since then, I learned how to use the fancy quilling tools and have made some pretty neat creations! However, the best kind of project to 
                        make (in my opinion) are cards, because they are fun and easy to make and are very usable. Who doesn't love recieving a hand-made card?</p>
